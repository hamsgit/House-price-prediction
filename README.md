# House-price-prediction
## Project Description
This project predicts house prices based on property features such as size, number of bedrooms, and year built. Using machine learning models, it analyzes historical housing data to provide accurate price estimates for new properties.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** – main programming language
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data processing and manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – data visualization

## Why Useful
- Helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions based on predicted house prices.
- Demonstrates practical use of machine learning in real estate and finance.
- Serves as a foundation for more advanced AI/ML projects, including regression, feature engineering, and predictive analytics.
